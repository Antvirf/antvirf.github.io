*Popup messages that animate nicely and can be dismissed with a click*

## Dependencies

This article assumes you are using a recent version of Django (~4.2). You'll also need to install [Hyperscript](https://hyperscript.org/docs/#install).

For the ability to create messages *without a full-page refresh*, you'll also need [HTMX](https://htmx.org/docs/#installing).

### Setup: Add `messages` to your base template, style them appropriately and add a dash of Hyperscript magic

In order for your messages to be displayed, they need to be included somewhere in your Django templates. In most cases, you'll have a `root.html` template of some kind that defines your imports, meta options and so on - something that every page served by your application uses. This is the ideal place for a `messages` component since you don't want to manually have to 'enable' messages on a particular page.

The below snippet from a root template shows how to do this:

```html
# templates/root.html
<ul class="messages" id="messages" hx-swap-oob="true">
{% if messages %}
    {% for message in messages %}
    <li {% if message.tags %} class="{{ message.tags }}"{% endif %}
    _="on click remove me
    on load wait 2s then add .message-deleting then wait 1s then remove me">
    {{ message }}
    </li>
    {% endfor %}
{% endif %}
```

The only "magic" part of this implementation is the bit starting with "`_=`" inside the `<li>` tag. This is [Hyperscript](https://hyperscript.org/), and is used to (a) delete the message immediately on click; and (b) delete the message after a certain period of time. Animations are done in CSS and included below. The syntax of Hyperscript is explicit and self-documenting: a notification can be removed by clicking on it, otherwise it will disappear after 2 seconds via an animation.

The CSS used in this example isn't special in any way. You can find it in the expandable section below.

```css
.messages {
  /* colors for different message types can be listed here */
  --color-info: #d9f0fc;
  --color-info-hover: #b4e0f7;
  --color-info-border: #50b6f5;

  /* Place on top of everything, at the right side of the page, without affecting any other elements.*/
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  right: 0;
  z-index: 9999;
  padding: 0.5em;
  pointer-events: none;
}

@keyframes slideInFromTop {
  0% {
    transform: translateY(-100%);
    opacity: 0;
  }
  100% {
    transform: translateY(0);
    opacity: 0.92;
  }
}

@keyframes slideOutToTop {
  0% {
    transform: translateY(0);
    opacity: 0.92;
  }
  100% {
    transform: translateY(-100%);
    opacity: 0;
  }
}

.messages > li.message-deleting {
  animation: slideOutToTop 250ms ease-out 0s 1;
  animation-fill-mode: forwards;
}

.messages > li {
  animation: slideInFromTop 250ms ease-in 0s 1;
  opacity: 0.92;
  pointer-events: all;
  list-style: none;

  /* formatting to your taste */
  width: 15em;
  height: 3em;
  padding: 2em;
  border-radius: 0.5em;
  font-size: 0.8em;
  border-style: solid;
  border-width: 2px;

  /* center content and add other formatting options*/
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: space-between;
}

.messages > li.info {
  background-color: var(--color-info);
  border-color: var(--color-info-border);
}
.messages > li.info:hover {
  background-color: var(--color-info-hover);
}

```

### Usage: Messages with a full-page refresh

When following the standard request-response pattern with a full-page refresh, just use Django's messaging framework:

```python
# views.py

def my_view(request):
    # messages.NAME adds the class NAME to the HTML of the message
    messages.info(request, "Message popups the easy way ðŸ˜Ž")
    return HttpResponseRedirect(reverse("myapp:mypage"))
```

### Usage: Messages based on partial refreshes ()

With HTMX requests, besides adding a message in the view itself with e.g. `messages.success()` as shown above, you must ensure that the response that your HTMX request returns includes the `message` HTML component as well as well. If you just return a plaintext HTTP response, or use a template that does not include the message component, the popup will not work correctly.

As a simple example, if you want a response to return e.g. "OK ðŸ˜Ž" to replace an element where the user clicks a button, but also show a popup message at the top, the template should minimally return something like the example below:

```html
<ul class="messages" id="messages" hx-swap-oob="true">
    <li class="info">
        "Message popups the easy way ðŸ˜Ž"
    </li>
</ul>

<div id="my_custom_response_id">
    OK ðŸ˜Ž
</div>
```

By default, HTMX replaces just a single part of the DOM. In this case we want to replace something in the calling part of the DOM, but also update the messages component of the page separately - essentially doing two changes in different places of the page. To do that, we'll need to include and set the [`hx-swap-oob`](https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-swap-oob/) option as shown above.

To reduce repetition of the messages block across your partial templates, you can extract it out and reference it like this:

```html
{% extends "messages.html" %}
{% block content %}
<div id="my_custom_response_id">
    OK ðŸ˜Ž
</div>
{% endblock content %}
```
